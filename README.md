# MatrixCubeâ€”Distributed System Made Easy

MatrixCube is a fundamental library to build distributed systems without considering reliability, consistency as well as scalability, it facilitates building the distributed stateful applications since the developers only need to care about business logic on single node. Currently, it's based on multi-raft to provide replicated state machine and would evolve to paxos families to be more friendly for scenarios across multiple datacenters.

## Features
* Strong consistent persistence storage
* High availability
* Horizontal scalability
* Auto Rebalance
